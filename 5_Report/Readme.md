## ABSTRACT
Water, snow, dust, and road spray are all removed from a vehicle's windscreen by the windshield wipers. The early windshield wipers were manually operated by moving a lever located inside the vehicle's interior. Later wiper designs were powered by the manifold vacuum generated by the engine. In today's world, virtually all wipers are powered by an electric motor connected to a linkage system, and they are controlled by a knob located next to the steering wheel. The driver has the ability to control the speed of the wiper blades.

Modern windshield wipers can also be operated on an as-needed basis. The intermittent wiper option, as opposed to the continuous wiper option, cycles the wipers on and off every few seconds rather than operating continuously. It was in the 1970s that intermittent control made its debut in autos. A steady power source was used to control the original intermittent wipers, which were routed through a series of switches to achieve their functionality. Most automobile wipers are now controlled by a microprocessor, which is becoming increasingly common.

Many wiper systems in cars today are controlled by a rain sensor, which measures the speed at which raindrops hit the windshield and activates the wipers. The inputs from the sensor are evaluated by a microprocessor, which then calculates the speed at which the wipers should travel.

## Introduction

Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe the raindrops or any
water from the windscreen. Wipers are designed and made to clear the water
from a windscreen. Most of cars have two wipers on the windscreen, one on the
rear window and the other on each headlight. The wiper parts visible from
outside the car are the rubber blade, the wiper arm holding the blade, a spring
linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots.

Wiper system is automatically ON during the time of rainfall. The senor is fixed in the vehicle glass. The conductive (Touch) sensor is used in this project. It senses the rainfall and giving control signal to the control unit. The control unit activates the wiper motor automatically.

## Objective
   Our objective is to build a Wiper Control system using STM32 which is a 32-bit microcontroller IC.The wiper operation can be carried out with basic modes like On, speed change and Off. As STM32 contains only 1 push button, the same button is utilized for all operations.

## WORKING PROCESS

* The RED LED is considered for the ACC position. Once the push button is pressed for 2 seconds, the RED LED keeps continuously glowing until the stop of the engine signifying the engine condition to be turned ON.
* On press of the user input push button, the other three Blue, Green and Orange LEDs come ON one at a time with the set frequency. The frequency changes on every alternate key press, 3 frequency levels with 1, 4 and 8 Hz.
* The LED glow pattern stops on the 4th press; the wiper action starts with the next press.
* If the push button is pressed for 2 seconds continuously, the RED light goes off and the pattern stops bringing it to default position which signifies the engine is turned OFF.

# SWOT ANALYSIS

## Strength
* The wiper comes back to default position even if stooped in the middle
* Safety for the driver as well as the passengers in the vehicle
* Clear Visibility to the Driver for neat ride.

## Weakness
* The total cost of the wiper system is high if implemented in real-time.
* The major disadvantage is that STM32 contains only one button for all the operation
* User has to undergo a sequence to acquire desired result and can't attain his result directly with the press of the button.

## Opportunities
* Rain sensing and automatic operation can be implemented as further enhancement.

## Threats
* Replacing the board is not possible if it malfunctions.
* Can't have more functions as the functionality of the board is very basic.

# Components Used

## STM32

The STM32 family of 32-bit microcontrollers based on the Arm® Cortex®-M processor is designed to offer new degrees of freedom to MCU users. It offers products combining very high performance, real-time capabilities, digital signal processing, low-power / low-voltage operation, and connectivity, while maintaining full integration and ease of development.

## Servo Motor

A servomotor is a rotary actuator or linear actuator that allows for precise control of angular or linear position, velocity and acceleration. It consists of a suitable motor coupled to a sensor for position feedback.


## Resistors

A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow.


## Capacitor

A capacitor is a device that stores electrical energy in an electric field. It is a passive electronic component with two terminals. The effect of a capacitor is known as capacitance.

## LED's

A light-emitting diode is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it. Electrons in the semiconductor recombine with electron holes, releasing energy in the form of photons.


## Cables and Connector

A cable, also known as a cord, plug, or connector transmits power or data between devices or positions, which is covered in plastic by one or more wires.

## Push Button

A push-button or simply button is a simple switch mechanism to control some aspect of a machine or a process. Buttons are typically made out of hard material, usually plastic or metal.

## What
Wipers system are operated by an electric motor and vechile. And to ensure safety for the passengers and drivers during rainy conditions.

## Why
The main purpose of the wiper system is to clean the windscreen and to get a clear vision of the road.

## When 
It is recommended to operate during dust or rain

## Where
Wipers system can be activated by a lever located to the right of the steering wheel. Pulling the lever down should activate the windshield wipers on their lowest setting

## How
It is implemented with the help of STM32 with the desired operation of turning on the engine, changing of speeds and turning off with the help of Embedded c Programming.
