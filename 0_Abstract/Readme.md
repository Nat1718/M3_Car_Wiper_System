## Abstract
    Windshield wiper plays an important role in automobiles. It is  an  essential  requirement  in  almost  all  motor  vehicles including  trains,  aircrafts  and  watercraft.
    The automated  rain wiper  system is  used to detect rainfall and activate wiper automatically without driver interaction. 
    This  system  fulfills  the  safety  of  the  drivers  to  focus  on  their primary task of driving. At present, engineers are investigating fully automated systems that vary the speed of the wiper blades according to  the  rate  of  the  rainfall  and  the  speed  of  the  vehicle.  
    These systems  are  used  in  luxury  cars,  SUVs,  and  other  expensive automobiles.  So,  that  the aim  is  to  develop  an  automated  wiper system which varies the  speed of the wiper  blades with the rate of the  rainfall  for  non-expensive  automobiles  which  ordinary customers can  buy.
    The  project consists of simple  components; a simple  raindrop  sensor based  on  the  moisture  only it  shows  the resistance, micro-controller  and  regulators.  Furthermore,  projectâ€™s  future development  is to  set  it up  using a  standard  wiper motor  with a control system and low budget. 
    By adopting this technique we can achieve the high safety of driver as well as passengers.
